# Linear Regression

## Introduction
Using the [House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) dataset from Kaggle, our goal is to build a model using linear regression with gradient descent to predict housing prices given the size of living space in sqft. We then use matplotlib to visualise the gradient contour and the plot of our best-fit line in relation to data points.

# Support Vector Machine

## Introduction
This is just a basic implementation of SVM with reference to Siraj's Video, using a toy dataset that can be easily visualised on a 2D plane.
